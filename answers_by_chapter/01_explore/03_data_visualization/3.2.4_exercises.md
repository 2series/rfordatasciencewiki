================

**Question 1:** Run `ggplot(data = mpg)`. What do you see?

**Code & Output:**

``` r
# load ggplot2 into our workspace
# we could also do library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2) 
# the code we're asked to run in question 1:
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

**Explanation:** We see a grey square with a white border, which isn't very helpful.

Remember from the chapter that graphs in `ggplot2` require two main components: `ggplot()` and `geom_function()`.

`ggplot()` tells R that we want to draw a [coordinate system](%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system%22), which is exactly what we've done when we ran `ggplot(data = mpg)`. Even though we told R what data set to use, we didn't specify what to *do* with the dataset.

We tell R what we want to do with a given dataset when we combine `ggplot()` with `geom_function()`. `geom_function()` isn't an *actual* function name, but the word `function` in `geom_function()` is a placeholder for any number of graph types, including (but not limited to) `geom_point()`, `geom_bar()`, and `geom_histogram()`.

You can read more about `ggplot2()` [here](%22http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/%22).

**Question 2:** How many rows are in `mpg`? How many columns?
